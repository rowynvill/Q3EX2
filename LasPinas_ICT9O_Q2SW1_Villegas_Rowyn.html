				<td><img src="Belgian.jpeg" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="bgcolor">Belgian Shepherd</td>
				<td>The Belgian Shepherd Dog was originally bred to herd sheep and is a medium-sized dog that is accustomed to the open-air life and built to resist the cold Belgian climate. It is the only breed in the world to have four separate varieties, all of which are structurally the same.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style="height:200px">
				<td><img src="Beaggle.jfif" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="overline">Beagle</td>
				<td>Beagle dog breeds are of English origin and were primarily bred to hunt hares and rabbits. These dogs are also called ‘scent hounds’, meaning they are known for their heightened sense of smell. They possess superior tracking skills, making them great hunters.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style="height:200px">
				<td><img src="Borzoi.jfif" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="linethrough">Borzoi</td>
				<td>The Borzoi (or Russian Wolfhound) originated in Russia and was bred as a hunting dog, using its excellent speed and sight to chase and run down foxes, hares and wolves. The agility and strength of the Borzoi lent itself perfectly to the great hunting traditions of the Russian aristocracy.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style="height:200px">
				<td><img src="BeardedCollie.jfif" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="underline">Bearded Collie</td>
				<td>The Bearded Collie has evolved during hundreds of years to perform specialised tasks in the service of man and was first bred by sheep farmers to work the rugged ranges of the Scottish Highlands. As its working ability was all that mattered, there was no concern for accurately recording their history. It is possible that the very early origins of the Bearded Collie may be found in the Polish Lowland Sheepdog, although this connection is not documented.</td>

			<tr style="height:200px">
				<td><img src="AmericanCockerSpaniel.jfif" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="combi">American Cocker Spaniel</td>
				<td>The Spaniel family is a large one, of considerable antiquity. There are two varieties of Cocker Spaniels – the English and the American. The American Cocker Spaniel is not a crossbred dog. It evolved in the US where breeders developed it from the English Cocker Spaniel to become the glamorous American type we see today.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style="height:200px">
				<td><img src="Akita.jfif" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="bgcolor">Akita</td>
				<td>The exact origin of the Akita remains unknown. Through skeletal remains and carbon dating, it was traced to 500 BC, although the Akita's specific breed history has only been recorded for the past 350 years. The Akita was also known as the Odate dog – named after the rugged mountainous area of Odate in the prefecture of Akita, on the island of Honshu in Japan.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style="height:200px">
				<td><img src="BassetHound.jfif" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="overline">Basset Hound</td>
				<td>The word Basset is French and means ‘low-set’. The first detailed proof of the Basset’s existence was in 1585 where they were used as badger dogs. Their original home was the region of Artois and Flanders.

				The French Basset Hound was first discovered in Britain, after the invasion by the Normans, in 1066. By the 1900s, packs were established and the breed was popular on the show bench. In 1957 Bassets were sent to Sydney, where today they are found throughout Australia.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style="height:200px">
				<td><img src="WelshCorgi.jfif" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="linethrough">Welsh Corgi</td>
				<td>The Pembroke Corgi originated from the hardy, bob-tailed cattle dogs of the Pembrokeshire area in Wales. Due to being chosen as a pet by the British Royal Family in 1935, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is now one of the best-known breeds in the world. It is highly successful in both show and obedience rings worldwide, and extremely popular as a family pet.

				The Cardigan Corgi - the Corgi with the tail - is one of the oldest of the Welsh dog breeds and is generally acknowledged as being the original Corgi or dwarf dog of Wales. Since ancient times it was used as a sheep and cattle herder, a guard dog, and friend and companion in the lonely crofters' huts of the remote Welsh hillside country of Cardiganshire.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style="height:200px">
				<td><img src="Malamute.jfif" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="underline">Alaskan Malamute</td>
				<td>Alaskan Malamutes are big, powerful active dogs that have been bred for their ability to pull heavy loads over long distances.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style="height:200px">
				<td><img src="Basenji.jpg" width="350" height="350"></td>
				<td class="combi">Basenji</td>
				<td>The Basenji, Africa's barkless dog, existed in the early days of the Pharaohs, and in fact the breed is older than the Pyramids themselves. It was not until 1895 that Western civilization discovered the Basenji in the Congo regions being used by the various tribes as a hunting dog. Even today, they are highly prized possessions, as without these little dogs, natives lose their prestige as hunters.</td>
